This was one the task on the course Advanced Statistics. The data from Apple equity were dowloaded using the FRED Api, other notebook in which we connected to this API and downloaded the data from 1986 to 2022.  Here are different metrics (rss, BIC, and R^2) used to choose the best predictors (variables) using the following featuring engineering techniques (methods): forward and backward stepwise selection, cross-validation, shrink methods (Lasso and Ridge) and finally, using dimensionality reduction by PCR and PSL technics. Is important to mention that the code was given by the teacher of the master program: Paula Mar\'eda Almonacid.}
